## About Me

I come from a background in Industrial & Systems Engineering, and over the past five years Iâ€™ve become enthralled with programming. I love using data to solve real-world problems, learning new open source tools, and building projects that blend engineering + analytics.

Some of my current interests: health & wellness, real estate, investing, crypto, and sports. Iâ€™m always exploring how technology intersects with these domains.
