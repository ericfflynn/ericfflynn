# Hi there üëã
Thanks for checking out my GitHub! My names Eric Flynn and I consider myself a data enthusiast. I come from a background in Industrial and Systems Engineering (ISE), and over the last 3 years I have become enthralled with computer programming and the data field. I love to learn new open-source technologies, and I use this GitHub to showcase my personal projects I've developed with them. 

Some of my interests include health and wellness, investing, real-estate, and cryptocurrency. I'm always looking for ways to apply my technical skills in these areas.
